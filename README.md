## Introducing Petti! A spice-rack of gravitational-wave data analysis pipelines using machine learning.
The name ✨*Petti*✨ was derived from the Tamil word _Anjarai Petti_ (அஞ்சறை பெட்டி, pronounced Añjaṟai peṭṭi), which is traditionally a round wooden or metal box used in Tamil Nadu to keep frequently used spices and herbs. It typically has six to nine small cups, each containing a separate kitchen favourite. **petti-gw** will contain several machine-learning based gravitational-wave data analysis pipelines, aptly named after spices, herbs and food in general.
